  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    In this project, I explore the application of Random Forest, a powerful ensemble machine learning algorithm, 
    to predict student academic outcomes using the UCI Student Performance dataset. This dataset contains detailed 
    records of students from Portuguese secondary schools, including demographic information, family background, 
    study habits, and previous grades.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is to develop a predictive model that classifies whether a student will <strong>pass</strong> or <strong>fail</strong> 
    based on key factors such as study time, school absences, and family support. Random Forest is particularly 
    well-suited for this task due to its ability to handle diverse types of data, model complex interactions, 
    and reduce overfitting by aggregating predictions from multiple decision trees.
  </p>
  <p>
    By leveraging this method, the project aims to identify the most influential variables affecting student success 
    and demonstrate how data-driven insights can support educational decision-making and personalized interventions.
  </p>

    <figcaption>1.1. Random Forest Classifier</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The Random Forest classifier was initialized with a fixed random seed for reproducibility. 
    This ensures that the same set of trees is generated each time the model is run, 
    which is essential when comparing results or sharing the analysis.
  </p>

    <img src="charts_Random_forest/2_Visual_of_seeds.png" alt="Visualization of one decision tree from the Random Forest">
    <figcaption>1.2. Decision Tree</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Although Random Forest builds many trees, the figure above shows a single decision tree as an example. 
    Each split is based on a student feature such as grades, study time, or absences. 
    The tree helps illustrate how the model makes pass/fail decisions, though in practice 
    Random Forest relies on the aggregated predictions of hundreds of such trees for stability and accuracy.

    <figcaption>1.3. Classification Report</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The classification report indicates an overall accuracy of <strong>87%</strong>. 
    The precision, recall, and F1-scores are strong for both the "pass" (1) and "fail" (0) categories, 
    with the model performing slightly better at identifying students who will pass. 
    This demonstrates the effectiveness of Random Forest in handling imbalanced student outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2 id="evaluation">Model Evaluation</h2>

  <figure class="chart-section">
    <img src="charts_Random_forest/4_random_results.png" alt="Confusion matrix for Random Forest model predictions">
    <figcaption>1.4. Confusion Matrix</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The confusion matrix further confirms the classification performance. Out of 79 students, 
    the model correctly predicted <strong>23 out of 26 fails</strong> and <strong>46 out of 53 passes</strong>. 
    Only a small number of students were misclassified, which is acceptable in most educational prediction contexts.
  </p>

  <figure class="chart-section">
    <img src="charts_Random_forest/5_feauture_importance.png" alt="Feature importance scores from the Random Forest model">
    <figcaption>1.5. Random Forest Feature Importance</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Feature importance analysis reveals that the strongest predictors of academic success 
    are the studentsâ€™ previous grades (<strong>G1</strong> and <strong>G2</strong>). 
    Other influential variables include absences and number of past failures. 
    Social and demographic features such as school support or family support had less predictive power. 
    This suggests that academic history outweighs external factors when predicting performance outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of <strong>87%</strong>, demonstrating strong predictive performance 
    in classifying student outcomes. The classification report highlights high precision and recall for both 
    pass and fail categories, while the confusion matrix confirms balanced predictive capability.
  </p>
  <p>
    The feature importance analysis shows that <strong>previous grades (G1 and G2)</strong> are the most critical factors 
    influencing student performance, followed by absences and number of failures. This aligns with expectations, 
    as academic history is a strong predictor of future success.
  </p>
  <p>
    These findings suggest that targeted interventions could be designed to support students with low prior grades, 
    high absenteeism, or multiple past failures. By focusing resources on these areas, schools can take a more 
    proactive approach in preventing academic failure and promoting student success.
