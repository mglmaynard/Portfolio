  <h2>Introduction: Predicting Student Performance Using Random Forest</h2>

  <p>
    In this project, I explore the application of <strong>Random Forest</strong>, a powerful ensemble machine learning algorithm, to predict student academic outcomes using the <strong>UCI Student Performance dataset</strong>. This dataset contains detailed records of students from Portuguese secondary schools, including demographic information, family background, study habits, and previous grades.

    <p>
      <strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
      This figure summarizes the dataset’s key features, including demographic details like age and gender, academic information such as prior grades (G1, G2), and contextual variables like study time and absences. Understanding this overview helps highlight the diversity of factors influencing student success and sets the foundation for modeling.

  <p>
    The goal is to develop a predictive model that classifies whether a student will pass or fail based on key factors such as study time, school absences, and family support. Random Forest is particularly well-suited for this task due to its ability to handle diverse types of data, model complex interactions, and reduce overfitting by aggregating predictions from multiple decision trees.

    <p class="figure-caption"><em>Figure 2: How Random Forest Combines Multiple Decision Trees</em></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
      This illustration depicts how a Random Forest aggregates predictions from numerous decision trees, each trained on different subsets of the data. By averaging these predictions (for regression) or taking a majority vote (for classification), the model improves accuracy and reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree.

    By leveraging this method, the project aims to identify the most influential variables affecting student success and demonstrate how data-driven insights can support educational decision-making and personalized interventions.

    <p>
      <strong>Interpretation:</strong><br />
      This chart shows the relative importance of different features in predicting whether a student passes or fails. For example, prior grades (G1, G2), study time, and number of absences often rank highest, indicating these factors strongly influence the model’s decisions. This insight can guide educators on which areas to focus for improving student outcomes.
