  <h1>Rental Price Distribution Analysis in NCR and Region IV-A via Kernel Density Estimation</h1>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p>
    This study focuses on the National Capital Region (NCR) and Region IV-A (Calabarzon) due to their significant economic contributions and high population densities within the Philippines. NCR contributes around 36% of the country’s GDP and is the most densely populated region. Region IV-A is the fastest-growing region and accounts for about 20% of the national GDP.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Both regions experience strong demand for rental housing driven by rapid urbanization and diverse housing needs, ranging from affordable units to high-end apartments. Understanding rental price distributions in these areas is crucial for informed housing policies and development strategies addressing the country’s most dynamic rental markets.
  </p>

  <h2>Price Distribution of Housing Rent on NCR and Region IV-A</h2>

  <p>
    Before we begin our analysis, let's take a look at price distribution of housing rents for NCR.
  </p>
      
  <figure class="chart-section">
    <img src="KDE_charts/1_Raw_Data_Distribution.png" alt="Price Distribution of Housing Rent on NCR and Region IV-A">
    <figcaption>1.1. Price Distribution of Housing Rent on NCR</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Similarly, let's do the same for Region IV-A
  </p>
      
  <figure class="chart-section">
    <img src="KDE_charts/1.2_Raw_Data_Distribution.png" alt="Price Distribution of Housing Rent on NCR and Region IV-A">
    <figcaption>1.2. Price Distribution of Housing Rent on Region IV-A</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <p>
    It is noticeable that both regions had it's peak on the range of Php 4-6K. Curious on the share of distribution of each range, we take a look on the side-by-side comparison of their share below:
  </p>

  <figure class="chart-section">
    <img src="KDE_charts/2_percent_dist.png" alt="Price Distribution of Housing Rent on NCR and Region IV-A">
    <figcaption>1.3. Share of Distribution of each Price Range</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Based on figure 1.3, NCR has higher shares on the ranges exceeding Php 6K, while Region IV-A has higher shares on the ranges below Php 4K. This is indicative to the thought that renting households in Region IV-A are more price sensitive compared to those in NCR. Furthermore, figure 1.3 seems to follow a normally distributed curve. Is it the case that household rentals for NCR and Region IV-A are normally distributed? To answer that let's take a look at the chart below:
  </p>

  <figure class="chart-section">
    <img src="KDE_charts/3.1_test_for_noormality.png" alt="Price Distribution of Housing Rent on NCR and Region IV-A">
    <figcaption>1.4. Density of NCR Household Rental Prices</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    In this analysis, we examined the distribution of rental prices in NCR using grouped data categorized into price brackets. Since the data is reported in ranges (e.g., Php 1,001–Php 1,500), we represented each price bracket by its midpoint value to approximate the rental price for that category.
  </p>

  <p>
    To analyze the distribution more accurately, we created a weighted dataset by repeating each midpoint value according to the number of renter households in that price bracket. For example, if 25,699 households fall within the Php 1,001–Php 1,500 bracket, the midpoint of Php 1,250 was repeated 25,699 times to simulate individual rental prices.
  </p>

  <p>
    From this weighted dataset, we calculated two key statistical parameters:

Mean (μ): The average rental price, indicating the central tendency of the data.

Standard Deviation (σ): The measure of spread or variability in rental prices around the mean.
  </p>

  <p>
  Using these parameters, we fitted a normal distribution curve to the data. The normal distribution is a well-known probability distribution characterized by its bell shape and is commonly used to model real-world continuous data. The curve's shape is determined by the mean and standard deviation of the dataset.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Plotting this curve alongside the histogram of actual rental prices allowed us to visually assess how closely the rental price data follows a normal distribution. This approach helps summarize the rental market, identify typical rental price ranges, and understand the variability in prices.
  </p>

  <p>
    By modeling the data in this way, we gain insights that can support forecasting, decision-making, and further statistical analyses.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We can see that NCR household rental prices doesn't follow a normal distribution pattern.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Based on the result of the PCA, "Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco" yielded the highest score, while "Information and Communication" had the lowest score. Could it be the case that "Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco" is more susceptible to inflation, while "Information and Communication" is more resilient? For simplicity, the figure below shows the top 5 highest PC1 and the top 5 lowest PC1.
  </p>

   <figure class="chart-section">
    <img src="charts/10_Top_PC1_and_PC2_untrimmed.png" alt="PCA Chart - Untrimmed">
    <figcaption>1.4. Top 5 Highest and Top 5 Lowest PC1</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    From the Top 5 highest PC1, "Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco" stands out the most as it does not only record the highest PC1, but its PC1 score is 3x more than the second highest. While, "Information and Communication" have lowest PC1 scores across all commodities. To further visualize the gaps between commodities and their relationship to CPI, we'll be using K-Means Clustering. But assigning the value of K would be vital. So we'll be gathering the respective Silhouette Scores of each value of K from 1 to 10. We'll be using the Python code below to plot the result.
  </p>
  
  <figure class="chart-section">
    <img src="charts/3_Silhouette_Score_trimmed_py_code.png" alt="PCA Chart - Untrimmed">
    <figcaption>1.5. Python Code for Determining K via Silhouette Score</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    After using the python code, we end up with the chart below. It is evident that k=2 had the highest Silhouette Score, meaning we'll be using only 2 clusters for our clustering.
  </p>
  
  <figure class="chart-section">
    <img src="charts/6_Silhouette_Score_untrimmed.png" alt="PCA Chart - Untrimmed">
    <figcaption>1.6. Result of Silhouette Score</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    However, just by looking at the clustering figure below, it is easy to see that one outlier belongs to no group. Going back to figure 1.2, we know that the outlier is "Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco". This comes as no surprise since it recorded the highest PC1 score earlier, even exceeding more than 3x the second in terms of PC1 score. Furthermore, the Philippine Government has a law, called "Sin Tax Reform Law of 2012", where "Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco" (ABT) is imposed more taxes compared to other commodity goods. Hence, price for ABT is more driven by policy regulation rather than inflation, resulting to sharp increase in price. Hence, it would be best to remove ABT from the data set in order to avoid skewing our results and analysis.
  </p>

  <figure class="chart-section">
    <img src="charts/4_KMeans_untrimmed.png" alt="PCA Chart - Untrimmed">
    <figcaption>1.7. K-Means Clustering</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2>Key Insights and Refined Clustering</h2>
  
  <p>
    With that, we end up with a trimmed PCA chart as shown below. This PCA chart excludes ABT from the data set as it is considered an outlier and would not help in identifying actual clusters of commodity goods.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After removing ABT from the chart, the range of PC1 and PC2 are now tighter compared to that of figure 1.2. Furthermore, the explained variance calculated for the new trimmed data is 99.12% and 0.63% for PC1 and PC2, respectively. This indicates that the initial result of PC1 holding more value over PC2 still holds true for our trimmed data.
  </p>

  </figure>
  
  <p>
  We then proceed to check if there is difference in the recommendation of K based on Silhouette score.  
  </p>

  <figure class="chart-section">
    <img src="charts/7_Silhouette_Score_trimmed.png" alt="PCA Chart - Untrimmed">
    <figcaption>2.2. Updated Result of Silhouette Score based on Trimmed CPI</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <p>
    Based on the result of the updated Silhouette Score above, four (4) would be the optimal assignement of number of clusters.
  </p>

  <figure class="chart-section">
    <img src="charts/8_KMeans_trimmed.png" alt="PCA Chart - Untrimmed">
    <figcaption>2.3. K-Means Cluster of Trimmed CPI</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    We then end up with the clustering chart above. We can identify four (4) unique clusters, namely: red, brown, purple, and grey.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The red cluster consists of basic necessities and consistent services like sports, recreation, water, and education. The red cluster usually falls between -2.5 to 0 PC1. These commodities are less volatile to price changes.</li>
    <li>The brown cluster consists of goods more sensitive to external economic conditions like transportion, food, accomodation, and restaurants. It falls between +2.5 to +5 of PC1.</li>
    <li>The purple cluster consists only of Financial Services. This might indicate that Financial Services are highly volatile to price changes and inflation. Since financial institutions depend on lending margins, credit demand, and investment returns, they are sensitive to interest rate changes, which are driven by CPI. Inflation could also reduce consumers' purchasing power which could be more riskier for financial institutions which could then lead to them increasing rates to mitigate possible losses.</li>
    <li>The grey cluster consists only of Information and Communication. It has a PC1 of less than -7.5. This might indicate that inflation doesn't really trigger change in its prices. Internet and other communication means prices are relatively stable. Adding more context to their costs also helps understand why they're rarely affected by inflation. For simplicity, their fixed costs are high, but their variable costs are low. Towers, cables, and satellites are materials needed for their business and comes with high capital. However, they have low variable cost per user. Hence, need for price changes is rarely needed. It could also be the case that there could have been changes in the perception and need for internet. Previously, internet was seen as a luxury rather than a necessity, but with current subscription prices and it's demand inelasticity, this could point out that internat has now been a necessity for some or at least perceived as a necessity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Overall, this study only shows commodities and goods that are more related to each other and how changes in CPI affect each cluster as a whole. A further study across all commodities per identified cluster would be great to further dig dive factors affecting each prices and consumer behavior.
