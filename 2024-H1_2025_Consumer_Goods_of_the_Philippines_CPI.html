  <h1>2024 - H1 2025 Analysis of Consumer Price Index (CPI) of the Philippines</h1>
  <p>This portfolio showcases visualizations and insights from Philippine inflation data (2024â€“H1 2025).</p>

  <p>
    The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) has released Consumer Price Index (CPI) of goods in the Philippines with respect to 2018 prices.
    The following are the complete list of goods in the PSA report:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages</li>
    <li>Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco</li>
    <li>Clothing and Footwear</li>
    <li>Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and Other Fuels</li>
    <li>Furnishings, Household Equipment and Routine Household Maintenance</li>
    <li>Health</li>
    <li>Transport</li>
    <li>Information and Communication</li>
    <li>Recreation, Sport and Culture</li>
    <li>Education Services</li>
    <li>Restaurants and Accommodation Services</li>
    <li>Financial Services</li>
    <li>Personal Care, and Miscellaneous Goods and Services</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    CPI is a metric used to reveal inflation and cost of living. An increase in CPI is indicative to an increase in price relative to a certain period of time. Last June 2025, PSA reports that the CPI of common goods rose to 127% relative to 2018 prices. In this page, we will discuss which goods are mostly affected and which ones are not to identify which ones are more prone to inflation and those that are more resistant to it. We will be using Python as a tool help us cluster our data and have a meaningful analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
  Before we begin clustering, let's standardize our data and do Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify our analysis. The code displayed below is a python code which we used to do the standardization and PCA.  
  </p>

    <h2>1.1. Python Code on Standardization and PCA Generation</h2>

  </div>
  
  <p>
    So that being said, we let's take a look on the PCA of consumer goods as seen on the chart below:
  </p>

  <div class="chart-section">
    <h2>1.2. PCA of Consumer Price Index</h2>
    <img src="charts/1_PCA_of_CPI_untrimmed.png" alt="PCA Chart - Untrimmed">
  </div>

  <p>
    Our PCA chart has two (2) dimensions, with the x-axis being the PC1 and y-axis being the PC2. To further disect the PCA, we take a look on the figure below to see the the scores of each PCA, namely PC1 and PC2.
  </p>

  <div class="chart-section">
    <h2>1.3. PC1 and PC2 Scores</h2>
    <img src="charts/9_PC1_and_PC2_untrimmed.png" alt="PCA Chart - Untrimmed">
  </div>

  <p>
    Notice that PC1 has far higher scores than PC2, with 99.71% vs that 0.21% of PC2. This means that PC1 is more corelated to CPI values than PC2. With that, we focus on the x-axis component of figure 1.1.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Based on the result of the PCA, "Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco" yielded the highest score, while "Information and Communication" had the lowest score. Could it be the case that "Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco" is more susceptible to inflation, while "Information and Communication" is more resilient? For simplicity, the figure below shows the top 5 highest PC1 and the top 5 lowest PCA.
